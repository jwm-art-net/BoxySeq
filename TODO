Next phase of development should focus on:

* use the 'grid editor' window as the main application window
* add a ruler to the grid editor view showing pitch/velocity information.
* implement keyboard shortcuts (for zooming especially)
* implement mute/unmute flag of grid_boundary
* allow mute/unmute of grid boundary through GUI
* add menu to main application window (with very little in it)
* boundary dialog boxes for control/informational purposes
