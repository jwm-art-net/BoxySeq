Next phase of development should focus on:

* allow re-ordering of grbound_manager list of grid boundaries.
  in the GUI it can be very noticible when two boundaries overlap
  each other that one is processed before the other.
  
* grid boundary lines should not be so clunky looking.
* add a ruler to the grid editor view showing pitch/velocity information.
* implement keyboard shortcuts (for zooming especially)
* add menu to main application window (with very little in it)
* boundary dialog boxes for control/informational purposes


24th September 2010 *** DONE ***:
* implement mute/unmute flag of grid_boundary
* allow mute/unmute of grid boundary through GUI

24th September 2010 *** DONE ***:
* use the 'grid editor' window as the main application window
