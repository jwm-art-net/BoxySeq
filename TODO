Next phase of development should focus on:

******
* row smart placement algorithm failing for area n x n
  in boundary n x n, where n > USE_nBIT_ARRAY.
******

* keyboard shortcuts for placement options.

* user-defined block box placement (user-block).
  a box drawn by the user which blocks an area
  from being occupied by anything else.

* bool freespace_test(freespace*, int x, int y, int width, int height)
  needs to be implemented for probable use by user-block placement.

* figure out how user-block placement will actually work with regard
  to overlap. a userblock can be placed which overlaps event boxes
  and other userblocks. how dealing with this overlap with regard
  to adding freespace back to the grid requires considerable attention
  (by my standards at least ;-).

* selection/grouping of multiple boundaries so that
  transposition can occur on multiple boundaries and
  to allow key and scale modulation, as well as increment
  or decrement velocity.

* allow re-ordering of grbound_manager list of grid boundaries.
  in the GUI it can be very noticible when two boundaries overlap
  each other that one is processed before the other.
  
* grid boundary lines should not be so clunky looking.
* add a ruler to the grid editor view showing pitch/velocity information.
* implement keyboard shortcuts (for zooming especially)
* add menu to main application window (with very little in it)
* boundary dialog boxes for control/informational purposes


24th September 2010 *** DONE ***:
* implement mute/unmute flag of grid_boundary
* allow mute/unmute of grid boundary through GUI

24th September 2010 *** DONE ***:
* use the 'grid editor' window as the main application window
