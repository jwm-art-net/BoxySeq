Currently I'm concentrating on the backend mechanics of boxyseq. While 
there is a rudimentary GUI, there is very little that can be done within 
it.

The thing about this is, I've put very little in place which will allow 
the user to interact via the GUI with the backend. In other words, I've 
not considered how to make such operations happen in a thread safe way.

There is only one data structure in place which can handle this, and 
that is the pattern data structure. The thread safety is based upon the 
assumption pointer assignment (ie assignment to a pointer, ptr = &something)
is thread safe. The code built up around this was a PITA to write and 
has so far put me off from transferring the idea to all the other (many 
and varied) data structures in the program.
