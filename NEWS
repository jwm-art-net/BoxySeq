    * grid boundaries can be re-ordered.
      with a boundary selected, press the - or + key
      to bring it forward or backward in the boundary list
      respectively. it is however not at all clear.

    * arrow keys will move the selected boundary 1 grid location
      in the specified direction at a time.

    * grid boundaries now have three states:
            play, block, and ignore.
      the play state is the normal state. in the block state,
      all events are treated as blocks. the ignore state ignores
      all events.

    * three keyboard shortcuts for controlling the boundary
      states:
          p or P to play events as normal
          b or B to turn all events into blocks
          i or I to ignore all events

       only effects the boundary the mouse is currently hovering
       over.

    * Oops, yesterday was Thursday and not Wednesday.
    * The display of the grid is now within the main window
      (ie, below the time display and transport control buttons).
    * Finer zoom step-sizes.


* Wednesday 23rd September 2010

After an extended break from programming during which I changed
web hosts and domain name registrars for jwm-art.net, and then
suffered from some kind of creative i hate everything it's worthless
crisis, I'm back programming again:

    * The grid editor now has zoom control
    * The grid itself (which does not have any grid lines ;-)
      is now centered when it is smaller than the viewport.
    * Space in the window which is not the grid is grey
      rather than the black of the grid.

Hmmm, well actually, I had started work on an FLTK version of Boxyseq
during August. It stagnated when I discovered it had the potential to
end up with the same problems as the Cairo/GTK version because FLTK
can be compiled with Cairo.

So basically, I've decided development of the BoxySeq GUI will proceed
using Cairo and the (deprecated) GDK and the FLTK versions are abandoned.

    * The boundaries are now resizable via right-mouse click

* Sunday 15th August 2010

    * Something which I shall name as a 'fix' 'fixes' the
      problem with the l2r placement where the right edge
      of a box would often extend past the right edge of
      the boundary which it was supposed to fit within.

    * The GUI now displays grid boundaries. A simple demo
      means you can click-drag the boundary around. release
      the click to set the new position.


* Tuesday 10th August 2010

    * Pressing the grid button for the first time changes
      the key and scale of the grbound placement. So connect
      boxyseq up to your fave synth and listen to what it does
      *BEFORE* pressing the 'grid' button :-)

* Monday 9th August 2010

    * Mainly code changes signalling the start of getting
      GUI ready for actual user interaction as opposed to
      user passivity.

* Wednesday 4th August 2010

    * The display is looking a bit spiffier.

    * Event boxes change colour after note-off during the
      release phase.

    * Events are removed upon stop/reposition transport

    * etc, lots of stuff which doesn't sound that much
      when i write it like this.


* Saturday 31st July 2010

* note off events are generated for all notes currently playing
  upon a transport reposition, transport stop, and application
  quit.


* 15:16 Sunday 4th July 2010

i've been attempting to investigate the source of a certain 
problem involving events which are placed within the grid but 
for what ever reason fail to be removed.

i've been using the 'sprinkle the code with debug statements 
showing the value of relevant variables' approach to as yet, 
no result.

i am still yet to find any identifiable pattern which the
events which are not removed share. i am yet to find anything
which provides a lead. i need to do a cold hard reboot to
prove to myself that it's not a memory error which is using
old bytes from second hand pre-used (ie free()d memory from
previous program run or whatever).

valgrind bring up uninitialized values in midi_out_port.c
and i was shirly fure i noticed a potential cause of these
but alas no the event boxes still stick in the grid refusing
to be peeled off.

...

i have found though a bug instead elsewhere. this little 
blighter was nibbling away at the free space code - causing 
events with  width > (boundary_width / 2 - 2) to not be 
placed. luckily, this was a incredibly simple minded bug and 
took no persuasion in moving him in to the neighbours garden 
where last seen looked very happy and at home.

further news on this day of Sunday 4th July 2010:

further news, from the past few days:

* timebase is um, erroneous, BoxySeq's 145bpm seems slower
than Ardour2's 145bpm. i began investigating this but
somehow got distracted and went on a mission to investigate
the non-removal of certain choice event boxes.

boxyseq is now sequencing and outputting MIDI to JACK!

Hurrah!
