to build boxyseq you can, but don't have to, choose the GUI you want to use:

choose one of three options:

1) gdk - (default) uses deprecated gdk functions for drawing - superior performance to cairo.
2) cairo - does not use any deprecated drawing functions, performance suffers*.
3) fltk - this is not yet implemented so do not choose this one!

*in theory it should be possible to improve my code to be a lot more intelligent about what it draws.


enter the following in a terminal to bring up the ccmake utility to change the GUI type:

ccmake .
cmake .
make
