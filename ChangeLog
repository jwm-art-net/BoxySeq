    * grid_boundary.c (grid_remove_events): added calls to clear remaining     buffers.

    * jack_midi.c (all): deleted/moved to jack_process.c

    * jack_transport.c (all): deleted/moved to jack_process.c

    * jack_process.c (all): new file is a conglomeration of the code
    formerly found in jack_midi.c and jack_transport.c. The API is now
    more concise with less implementation leaking into it.

    * include/jack_process_data.c: new file, contains a single data 
    structure used by jack_process.c implementation. Is a merger of the
    two data structures originally contained in jack_midi.c and 
    jack_transport.c.

    * jack_process.c (jd_rt_poll, jack_process_callback): additional
    stopped/started detection, new transport reposition detection. These
    trigger a call to boxyseq_rt_clear to wipe all event data from buffers
    etc, as well as disabling the duplication/dropped ticks messages on
    transport repositions.

    * jack_process.c (jack_process_callback): some playhead fiddling
    added to prevent dropped ticks when trying to synchronise with other
    timebase master applications.

*****        2010-07-29 was first ChangeLog entry for BoxySeq        *****
